# no-tests-nodejs-repo

A basic NodeJS repo to fulfill **my personal needs** of scaffolding various repos quickly.

## Description:
Though I highly discourage '*cookie-cutting*', this repository will be cloned for the purpose of experimenting with a variety of *mini* personal projects.

Such fundamentals (not just in regards to software) should not be a victim of mass-production. We have seen how this plays out in buildings, fashion, education and countless other dicplines. 

I highly encourage you not to copy this, as it specifically catered to needs of thee; for a very short period of time. People change, ideas change. In addition, this repo will also serve as a reminder on setting up certain dev-dependencies that I commonly forget. 

## Features:

* Formatting
* Type Checking
* Pre-commit validation

## Why This Will Be Useful:

* Demoing something real quick
* "Recloning" and "moving" parts of an existing repo
* Multiple trivial projects that do not fit under a single umbrella.
